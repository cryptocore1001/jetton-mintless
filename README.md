# TON-STABLE

FunC smart contracts for Stable Jetton on TON (for instance equivalent of US Dollar) issued by central entity.

# Targets and goals

This project was created to allow users to exchange and buy assets in the TON DeFi ecosystem for a jetton (token or currency) that is not subject to volatile fluctuations. To meet regulatory requirements, the issuer of the tokens must have additional control over the tokens.

Thus this jetton represents a [standard TON jetton smart contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/tree/369ae089255edbd807eb499792a0a838c2e1b272/ft) with additional functionality:

- Admin of jetton can make transfers from user's jetton wallet.

- Admin of jetton can burn user's jettons.

- Admin of jetton can lock/unlock user's jetton wallet (`set_status`). Admin can make transfer and burn even if wallet locked.

- Admin of jetton can change jetton-minter code and it's full data.

__⚠️ It is critically important for issuer to carefully manage the admin's account private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. It is highly recommend to use multi-signature wallet as admin account with private keys stored on different air-gapped hosts / hardware wallets.__

__⚠️ The contract does not check the code and data on `upgrade` message, so it is possible to brick the contract if you send invalid data or code. Therefore you should always check the upgrade in the testnet.__

# Local Development
